Given an array arr[], where each element is at most k positions away from its correct position in the sorted order.Your task is to restore the sorted order of arr[] by rearranging the elements in place.
Note: Don't use any sort() method.
Examples:
Input: arr[] = [2, 3, 1, 4], k = 2
Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]
Explanation: All elements are at most k = 2 positions away from their correct positions.Element 1 moves from index 2 to 0Element 2 moves from index 0 to 1Element 3 moves from index 1 to 2Element 4 stays at index 3
Input: arr[]= [7, 9, 14], k = 1
Output: [7, 9, 14]Explanation: All elements are already stored in the sorted order.
Constraints:1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 1060 ≤ k &lt; arr.size()1 ≤ arr[i]&nbsp;≤ 106
