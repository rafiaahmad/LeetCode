# [Ceil in a Sorted Array](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/ceil-in-a-sorted-array/1?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
## Easy
Given a sorted array&nbsp;arr[]&nbsp;and an integer&nbsp;x, find the index (0-based) of the smallest element in arr[] that is greater than or equal to x. This element is called the&nbsp;ceil of x. If such an element does not exist, return -1.
Note:&nbsp;In case of multiple occurrences of ceil of x, return the index of the first occurrence.
Examples
Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 8, 10, 11, 12, 19], x = 5
Output: 2
Explanation: Smallest number greater than 5 is 8, whose index is 2.
Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 8, 10, 11, 12, 19], x = 20
Output: -1
Explanation: No element greater than 20 is found. So output is -1.
Input: arr[] = [1, 1, 2, 8, 10, 11, 12, 19], x = 0
Output: 0
Explanation: Smallest number greater than 0 is 1, whose indices are 0 and 1. The index of the first occurrence is 0.
Constraints:1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 1061 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 1060 ≤ x ≤&nbsp;arr[n-1]
