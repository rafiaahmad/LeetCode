# [Multiply two strings](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/multiply-two-strings/1)
## Medium
Given two numbers as strings s1 and s2. Calculate their Product.Note: The numbers can be negative and&nbsp;You are not allowed to use any built-in function or convert the strings to integers. There can be zeros in the begining of the numbers. You don't need to specify '+' sign in the begining of positive numbers.
Examples:
Input: s1 = "0033", s2 = "2"
Output: "66"Explanation: 33 * 2 = 66
Input: s1 = "11", s2 = "23"
Output: "253"Explanation: 11 * 23  = 253
Input: s1 = "123", s2 = "0"
Output: "0"Explanation: Anything multiplied by 0 is equal to 0.
Constraints:1 ≤ s1.size() ≤ 1031 ≤ s2.size() ≤ 103
