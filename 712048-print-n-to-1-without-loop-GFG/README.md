# [Print N to 1 without loop](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/print-n-to-1-without-loop/1)
## Easy
Print numbers from N to 1&nbsp;(space separated) without the help of loops.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 10
Output: 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1

Your Task:
This is a function problem. You only need to complete the function printNos()&nbsp;that takes N as parameter and prints number from N to 1 recursively. Don't print newline, it will be added by the driver code.


Expected Time Complexity:&nbsp;O(N).
Expected Auxiliary Space:&nbsp;O(N) (Recursive).

Constraint
1&lt;=n&lt;=1000
